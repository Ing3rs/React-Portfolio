## Installation
If you'd like to install it and created your own portfolio, clone this repository and then open the command line and run 'npm install' to install the following dependencies: 

* React
* ReactDOM
* Bootstrap
* Jest
* Axios
* gh-pages
* React Social Icons: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-social-icons

Enter 'npm start' to preview the React portfolio in your browser.


## Next steps
In the future I would like to: 
* create a portfolio with all informtaion on one page rather than split into tabs
* make the contact form usable
* add a dark/light mode option
